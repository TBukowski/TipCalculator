A bare bones tip calculator app that with the following guidlines:

You enter the amount of the bill(allow 2 decimal places).
-select from a dropdown of typical tip percentages(5, 10,15,20,25,30).
-and number of people paying for the bill.
-Needs validation that an amount and percentage were selected.
-If nothing entered for number of people, assume 1.
